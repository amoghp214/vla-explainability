# Summary of Fixes to `record.py`

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

Your `record.py` script was **not following OpenVLA's LIBERO implementation**. After analyzing the official OpenVLA LIBERO evaluation script at:
https://github.com/openvla/openvla/blob/main/experiments/robot/libero/run_libero_eval.py

I found **4 critical bugs** that were causing the robot to barely move during playback.

---

## üìä Side-by-Side Comparison

### Bug 1: Action Unnormalization Key

| Before (‚ùå WRONG) | After (‚úÖ CORRECT) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| `unnorm_key="bridge_orig"` | `unnorm_key=task_suite_name` |
| Uses Bridge dataset statistics | Uses LIBERO task suite statistics |
| Actions in wrong scale | Actions properly scaled for LIBERO |

**Impact**: This was the **primary** reason the robot barely moved. Using Bridge statistics on LIBERO tasks results in actions that are orders of magnitude off.

---

### Bug 2: Manual Action Scaling

| Before (‚ùå WRONG) | After (‚úÖ CORRECT) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| ```python<br>scaled_action = action.copy()<br>scaled_action[:3] *= 10<br>scaled_action[3:6] *= 10<br>env.step(scaled_action)<br>actions.append(action)  # Saved wrong action!<br>``` | ```python<br># No manual scaling!<br>action = normalize_gripper_action(action)<br>action = invert_gripper_action(action)<br>env.step(action.tolist())<br>actions.append(action)  # Saves correct action<br>``` |

**Impact**: You were applying manual 10x scaling (a band-aid fix) AND saving the wrong action to the HDF5 file. This compounded the problem during playback.

---

### Bug 3: Gripper Action Processing

| Before (‚ùå WRONG) | After (‚úÖ CORRECT) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| No gripper processing | ```python<br>normalize_gripper_action(action, binarize=True)<br>invert_gripper_action(action)<br>``` |
| Gripper in [0, 1] range | Gripper in [-1, +1] range |
| Wrong sign convention | Correct sign for LIBERO |

**Impact**: Gripper might not open/close correctly, or might be stuck in wrong state.

---

### Bug 4: Image Resolution

| Before (‚ùå WRONG) | After (‚úÖ CORRECT) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 512x512 pixels | 256x256 pixels |
| Mismatched with training | Matches OpenVLA's LIBERO setup |

**Impact**: Minor, but using wrong resolution can degrade model performance.

## üîß What Changed in the Code

### 1. Added Helper Functions
```python
def normalize_gripper_action(action, binarize=True):
    """Normalize gripper from [0,1] to [-1,+1]"""
    action[-1] = 2.0 * action[-1] - 1.0
    if binarize:
        action[-1] = 1.0 if action[-1] > 0 else -1.0
    return action

def invert_gripper_action(action):
    """Flip gripper sign (OpenVLA convention -> LIBERO convention)"""
    action[-1] = -action[-1]
    return action
```

### 2. Updated Function Signature
```python
# Added task_suite_name parameter
def record_demo(bddl_file, out_file, model_flag="openvla", prompt=None, 
                task_suite_name="libero_spatial",  # NEW!
                device="cuda:0", cache_dir=None):
```

### 3. Fixed Environment Setup
```python
# OLD:
env_args = {
    "bddl_file_name": bddl_file,
    "camera_heights": 512,
    "camera_widths": 512,
}

# NEW:
env_args = {
    "bddl_file_name": bddl_file,
    "camera_heights": 256,  # Matches OpenVLA
    "camera_widths": 256,
}
```

### 4. Fixed Action Prediction and Execution
```python
# OLD:
action = vla.predict_action(**inputs, unnorm_key="bridge_orig", do_sample=False)
scaled_action = action.copy()
scaled_action[:3] *= LINEAR_SCALE_FACTOR  # Wrong!
scaled_action[3:6] *= ANGULAR_SCALE_FACTOR  # Wrong!
env.step(scaled_action)
actions.append(action)  # Saved wrong action!

# NEW:
action = vla.predict_action(**inputs, unnorm_key=task_suite_name, do_sample=False)
action = normalize_gripper_action(action, binarize=True)
action = invert_gripper_action(action)
env.step(action.tolist())
actions.append(action)  # Saves correct action!
```

### 5. Added CLI Argument
```python
parser.add_argument(
    "--task_suite_name", 
    type=str, 
    default="libero_spatial",
    choices=["libero_spatial", "libero_object", "libero_goal", "libero_10", "libero_90"],
    help="LIBERO task suite name (used for action unnormalization)"
)
```

## üöÄ How to Use the Fixed Script

### New Usage:
```bash
python scripts/record.py \
    --model openvla \
    --bddl_file path/to/task.bddl \
    --out_file output/demo.hdf5 \
    --prompt "pick up the mug" \
    --task_suite_name libero_spatial \  # MUST SPECIFY!
    --cache_dir path/to/cache
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Must specify `--task_suite_name`** (defaults to `libero_spatial`)
2. Uses correct action normalization for that suite
3. No more manual scaling needed
4. Properly processes gripper actions
5. Uses correct 256x256 resolution

## üìà Expected Results

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Robot barely moves during playback
- ‚ùå Actions too small (10x smaller than executed)
- ‚ùå Gripper doesn't work properly
- ‚ùå Wrong action statistics used

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ Robot moves properly during playback
- ‚úÖ Actions match what was executed
- ‚úÖ Gripper opens/closes correctly
- ‚úÖ Correct action statistics for LIBERO tasks

---

## üîç How to Verify the Fix

1. **Check action magnitudes:**
   ```python
   import h5py
   with h5py.File("demo.hdf5", "r") as f:
       actions = f["data/demo_0/actions"][()]
       print(f"Action range: [{actions.min():.3f}, {actions.max():.3f}]")
       print(f"Action shape: {actions.shape}")
   ```
   
   **Before**: Actions very small (e.g., [-0.1, 0.1])
   **After**: Actions in reasonable range (e.g., [-1.0, 1.0] or similar)

2. **Visual test:**
   ```bash
   python scripts/playback.py \
       --demo_file demo.hdf5 \
       --bddl_file task.bddl \
       --out_video playback.mp4
   ```
   
   **Before**: Robot barely twitches
   **After**: Robot moves significantly, attempts task

## üìö Reference

This implementation now follows the official OpenVLA LIBERO evaluation script:
- **Source**: https://github.com/openvla/openvla/blob/main/experiments/robot/libero/run_libero_eval.py
- **Key insight**: OpenVLA maintains separate action statistics for each dataset/task suite
- **Critical parameter**: `unnorm_key` must match the task suite name

---

## üéì Lessons Learned

1. **Always check the reference implementation** before implementing your own
2. **Action normalization is dataset-specific** - you can't mix statistics from different datasets
3. **Don't use manual scaling as a band-aid** - fix the root cause (wrong unnorm_key)
4. **Follow the exact preprocessing pipeline** - resolution, gripper processing, etc. all matter

---

**Bottom line**: Your script now matches how OpenVLA officially runs on LIBERO! üéâ
